The App provides an interface for users to scroll through the past 10 notifications that have been posted. If a user
wants to read more about a notification or simply see the source to veryify the notification they can click on a notification 
and it will display the source link and ask if they want to be taken to the page of the story. Additionally if a user wants 
to suggest a notification they are able to do so by clicking the tell us what you know button.
